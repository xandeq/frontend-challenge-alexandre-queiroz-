Coding Challenge PLAN A

Create a new project in your Github or Bitbucket repository. If your name is Darth MiddleName Vader, then your project should be called frontend-challenge-darth-vader.  The project consists of three pages:  A Login page for authentication and validation;  A home page showing a list of results coming from an API already developed;  A detail page showing the details of an element from that list of results.
